abstract = {Conspicuous deficits in face recognition characterize prosopagnosia. Information on whether agnosic deficits may extend to non-facial body parts is lacking. Here we report the neuropsychological description of {\{}FM{\}}, a patient affected by a complete deficit in face recognition in the presence of mild clinical signs of visual object agnosia. His deficit involves both overt and covert recognition of faces (i.e. recognition of familiar faces, but also categorization of faces for gender or age) as well as the visual mental imagery of faces. By means of a series of matching-to-sample tasks we investigated: (i) a possible association between prosopagnosia and disorders in visual body perception; (ii) the effect of the emotional content of stimuli on the visual discrimination of faces, bodies and objects; (iii) the existence of a dissociation between identity recognition and the emotional discrimination of faces and bodies. Our results document, for the first time, the co-occurrence of body agnosia, i.e. the visual inability to discriminate body forms and body actions, and prosopagnosia. Moreover, the results show better performance in the discrimination of emotional face and body expressions with respect to body identity and neutral actions. Since {\{}FM's{\}} lesions involve bilateral fusiform areas, it is unlikely that the amygdala-temporal projections explain the relative sparing of emotion discrimination performance. Indeed, the emotional content of the stimuli did not improve the discrimination of their identity. The results hint at the existence of two segregated brain networks involved in identity and emotional discrimination that are at least partially shared by face and body processing.},

Yet, prior studies have only explored predominately discreet lesions. Using advanced structural neuroimaging methods in 174 patients with a right-hemisphere stroke, we were able to identify three neural systems that contribute to AHP, when disconnected or directly damaged: the (i) premotor loop (ii) limbic system, and (iii) ventral attentional network. Our results suggest that human motor awareness is contingent on the joint contribution of these three systems.},

abstract = {Somatic misperceptions and misrepresentations, like supernumerary phantom limb and denial of ownership of a given body part, have typically been reported following damage to the right side of the brain. These symptoms typically occur with personal or extrapersonal neglect and extinction of left-sided stimuli, suggesting that all these different symptoms may be linked to the same neural substrate. In the present research, we tested two right brain-damaged (RBD) patients to find out whether changing the position of the hands in space influences tactile extinction and denial of ownership to the same extent. Results showed that manipulation of the spatial position of the hands reduces tactile extinction but leaves denial of ownership of the left hand unaffected. Such a dissociation suggests that delusional misperceptions may be independent from somatic neglect and that representation of hands in space and attribution of ownership are dynamically mapped in at least partly separate neural substrates.},

METHODS: Ten RBD patients (three with disorders of bodily representations) were asked to report whether movements of their right hand induced any illusory somatic or motor sensations. Inquiries on anomalous sensation of movement of the left hand were carried out while subjects: 1) observed the moving hand in a mirror propped vertically along the parasagittal plane; 2) looked directly at the moving hand; 3) looked at the still hand; 4) kept their eyes closed. Twelve healthy subjects served as controls. RESULTS: Movement of the right hand induced a very clear sensation of movement of the left, contralesional hand in two patients affected by body image disorders. Remarkably, this occurred mainly while subjects were looking in the mirror, that is, when conflicts between visual, somatic, and motor information were maximal. In no condition did control subjects report any consistent anomalous evoked movement or sensation. CONCLUSIONS: Illusory movements of the left, plegic hand contingent upon sensorimotor conflicts can be evoked in brain damaged patients with body image disorders.},

abstract = {Peripersonal space (PPS) representation is modulated by information coming from the body. In paraplegic individuals, whose lower limb sensory-motor functions are impaired or completely lost, the representation of PPS around the feet is reduced. However, passive motion can have short-term restorative effects. What remains unclear is the mechanisms underlying this recovery, in particular with regard to the contribution of visual and motor feedback and of interoception. Using virtual reality technology, we dissociated the motor and visual feedback during passive motion in paraplegics with complete and incomplete lesions and in healthy controls. The results show that in the case of paraplegics, the presence of motor feedback was necessary for the recovery of PPS representation, both when the motor feedback was congruent and when it was incongruent with the visual feedback. In contrast, visuo-motor incongruence led to an inhibition of PPS representation in the control group. There were no differences in sympathetic responses between the three groups. Nevertheless, in individuals with incomplete lesions, greater interoceptive sensitivity was associated with a better representation of PPS around the feet in the visuo-motor incongruent conditions. These results shed new light on the modulation of PPS representation, and demonstrate the importance of residual motor feedback and its integration with other bodily information in maintaining space representation.},

An extensive battery of 22 questionnaires concerning a variety of body related feelings was administered and the results were correlated to the 23 main clinical variables. Six different typologies of Corporeal Illusion emerged: Sensations of Body Loss; Body-Part 24 Misperceptions; Somatoparaphrenia-like sensations; Disownership-like sensations; Illusory motion and Misoplegia. All 25 of these (with the exception of Misoplegia) are modulated by clinical variables such as pain (visceral, neuropathic and 26 musculoskeletal), completeness of the lesion, level of the lesion and the length of time since lesion onset. In contrast, no 27 significant correlations between bodily illusions and personality variables were found. These results support data 28 indicating that at least some cognitive functions (in particular the body, action and space representations) are embodied 29 and that somatosensory input and motor output may be necessary to build and maintain a typical self-body 30 representation.},

abstract = {Anosognosia for hemiplegia ({\{}AH){\}} is characterized by a lack of awareness of motor disorders and appears associated with fronto-temporal-parietal damage. Neuropsychological evidence indicates that behavioral indices of residual forms of motor awareness may co-exist with explicit denial of impairment. Here we explore whether the attempt by {\{}AH{\}} patients to perform an action may disclose residual forms of motor awareness and whether such forms are underpinned by different neural structures. Twelve hemiplegic patients affected by {\{}AH{\}} were tested in tasks assessing: (i) implicit awareness ({\{}IA){\}}, indexed by discrepancies between verbal reports and actual motor behavior; (ii) emergent awareness ({\{}EA){\}}, indexed by increased verbal awareness induced by the attempt to perform actions. {\{}IA{\}} and {\{}EA{\}} were found in five and three patients, respectively. Lesion analysis indicates that while the lack of {\{}IA{\}} is associated with damage to subcortical white matter anterior to the basal ganglia, lack of {\{}EA{\}} is linked to damage to cortical regions including insulo-frontal, temporal and parietal structures. Our results indicate that deficits in explicit and implicit awareness are associated with lesions involving different cortico-subcortical structures. Moreover, the results show that the attempt to perform an action may ameliorate body awareness deficits and have implications for rehabilitation.},

Moreover, processing body form and body action relies on distinct neural substrates. Although brain lesion studies show specific face processing deficits, neuropsychological evidence for defective recognition of nonfacial body parts is lacking. By combining psychophysics studies with lesion-mapping techniques, we found that lesions of ventromedial, occipitotemporal areas induce face and body recognition deficits while lesions involving extrastriate body area seem causatively associated with impaired recognition of body but not of face and object stimuli. We also found that body form and body action recognition deficits can be double dissociated and are causatively associated with lesions to extrastriate body area and ventral premotor cortex, respectively. Our study reports two category-specific visual deficits, called body form and body action agnosia, and highlights their neural underpinnings.},

abstract = {Background: Clinical competence is the term used to describe an individual's capacity to express a choice regarding their participation in clinical procedures or experimental studies. Understanding the information provided is a prerequisite but consent forms are often lengthy and complicated. Alzheimer's disease patients may be vulnerable in written comprehension, due to cognitive deficits, but unfortunately to date, a specific evaluation of this ability is not included in periodical assessments. Methods: One hundred thirty Italian patients with Alzheimer's disease were compared with 130 controls in a comprehension task involving a simplified informed consent form. Their performance in this task was compared with their performance with two other types of reading material (a testament and a history text). In addition, the performance of a subgroup of very mild patients in this test was compared with their performance in a widely used interview for the assessment of clinical competence (MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool for Clinical Research). Results: Good sensitivity and specificity of the cut-offs identified consent form and the other texts as good instruments for evaluation of written comprehension. The comprehension of consent form may be compromised since the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. Nevertheless, a simplified, written text may help patients in comparison with interviews (MacCAT-CR). Better performance was correlated to the standard of education and better cognitive functions. Conclusion: Deficits regarding the comprehension of written texts and the consent form may be early in Alzheimer's disease patients and need to be investigated during periodical neuropsychological assessment. Comprehension may be facilitated by means of specific simplification strategies.},

abstract = {Anosognosia for hemiplegia (AHP) is informative about the neurocognitive basis of motor awareness. However, it is frequently associated with concomitant symptoms, such as hemispatial neglect and disturbances in the sense of body ownership (DSO). Although double dissociations between these symptoms have been reported, there is ongoing debate about whether they are manifestations of independent abnormalities, or a single neurocognitive deficit. We aimed to investigate the specificity of lesions associated with AHP by surpassing four, existing methodological limitations: (a) recruit a relatively large sample of patients (total N = 70) in a multi-centre study; (b) identify lesions associated with AHP in grey and white matter using voxel-based methods; (c) take into account the duration of AHP and concomitant neglect symptoms; and (d) compare lesions against a control hemiplegic group, patients suffering from AHP and DSO, and a few, rare patients with selective DSO. Results indicated that acute AHP is associated with a wide network, mainly including: (1) the Rolandic operculum, (2) the insula and (3) the superior temporal gyri. Subcortically, damage mainly involved the basal ganglia and white matter, mostly the superior corona radiate, arcuate fasciculus and the part of the ventral, superior longitudinal fasciculus. Persistent symptoms were linked with wider damage involving fronto-temporal cortex and long white matter tracts. A shift in the latero-medial direction (mainly involving the basal ganglia and surrounding white matter) emerged when DSO was taken accounted for. These results suggest that while bodily awareness is processed by areas widely distributed across the brain, intact subcortical structures and white matter tracts may be necessary to support basic feelings of owning and controlling contralateral body parts. An accurate and ‘up-to-date' awareness of our motor abilities, however, may rely also on intact processing in cortical areas which presumably allow higher-order inferences about the current state of the body.},

abstract = {Abstract Anosognosia is a multifaceted, neuro-psychiatric syndrome characterized by defective awareness of a variety of perceptuo-motor, cognitive or emotional deficits. The syndrome is also characterized by modularity, i.e., deficits of awareness in one domain (e.g., spatial perception) co-existing with spared functions in another domain (e.g., memory). Anosognosia has mainly been reported after right hemisphere lesions. It is however somewhat surprising that no studies have thus far specifically explored the possibility that lack of awareness involves apraxia, i.e., a deficit in the ability to perform gestures caused by an impaired higher-order motor control and not by low-level motor deficits, sensory loss, or failure to comprehend simple commands. We explored this issue by testing fifteen patients with vascular lesions who were assigned to one of three groups depending on their neuropsychological profile and brain lesion. The patients were asked to execute various actions involving the upper limb or bucco-facial body parts. In addition they were also asked to judge the accuracy of these actions, either performed by them or by other individuals. The judgment of the patients was compared to that of two external observers. Results show that our bucco-facial apraxic patients manifest a specific deficit in detecting their own gestural errors. Moreover they were less aware of their defective performance in bucco-facial as compared to limb actions. Our results hint at the existence of a new form of anosognosia specifically involving apraxic deficits.},

abstract = {Anosognosia for hemiplegia (AHP), or unawareness of motor deficits contralateral to a brain lesion, has lasting negative implications for the management and rehabilitation of patients. A recent, bedside psychophysical intervention, namely self-observation by video replay, lead to a lasting remission of severe AHP in an acute stroke patient (Fotopoulou, A., Rudd, A., Holmes, P., {\&} Kopelman, M. (2009). Self-observation reinstates motor awareness in anosognosia for hemiplegia. Neuropsychologia, 47, 1256-1260). This procedure has been adjusted and applied here, as the basis of two intervention protocols administered independently to two patients with severe AHP. The first study used multiple, successive sessions of video-based self-observation in an acute patient, targeting first the awareness of upper limb and subsequently lower limb paralysis. The second study used a single session of video-based, self- and other-observation in a patient at the chronic stage following onset. Both protocols also involved elements of rapport building and emotional support. The results revealed that video-based self-observation had dramatic, immediate effects on awareness in both acute and chronic stages and it seemed to act as an initial trigger for eventual symptom remission. Nevertheless, these effects did not automatically generalise to all functional domains. This study provides provisional support that video-based self-observation may be included in wider rehabilitation programmes for the management and restoration of anosognosia.},

abstract = {There is a vigorous debate as to whether visual perception and imagery share the same neuronal networks, whether the primary visual cortex is necessarily involved in visual imagery, and whether visual imagery functions are lateralized in the brain. Two patients with brain damage from closed head injury were submitted to tests of mental imagery in the visual, tactile, auditory, gustatory, olfactory and motor domains, as well as to an extensive testing of cognitive functions. A computerized mapping procedure was used to localize the site and to assess the extent of the lesions. One patient showed pure visual mental imagery deficits in the absence of imagery deficits in other sensory domains as well as in the motor domain, while the other patient showed both visual and tactile imagery deficits. Perceptual, language, and memory deficits were conspicuously absent. Computerized analysis of the lesions showed a massive involvement of the left temporal lobe in both patients and a bilateral parietal lesion in one patient. In both patients the calcarine cortex with the primary visual area was bilaterally intact. Our study indicates that: (i) visual imagery deficits can occur independently from deficits of visual perception; (ii) visual imagery deficits can occur when the primary visual cortex is intact and (iii) the left temporal lobe plays an important role in visual mental imagery.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies in animals and humans indicate that the interruption of body-brain connections following spinal cord injury (SCI) leads to plastic cerebral reorganization. OBJECTIVE: To explore whether inducing the Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI) via synchronous multisensory visuo-tactile bodily stimulation may reveal any perceptual correlates of plastic remapping in SCI. METHODS: In 16 paraplegic, 16 tetraplegic and 16 healthy participants we explored whether RHI may be induced by tactile stimuli involving not only the left hand but also the left hemi-face. Touching the participants actual hand or face was either synchronous or asynchronous with tactile stimuli seen on a rubber hand. We assessed two components of the illusion, namely perceived changes in the real hand in space (indexed by proprioceptive drift) and ownership of the rubber hand (indexed by subjective responses to an ad-hoc questionnaire). RESULTS: Proprioceptive drift and ownership were found in the healthy group only in the condition where the left real and fake hand were touched simultaneously. In contrast, no drift was found in the SCI patients who, however, showed ownership after both synchronous and asynchronous hand stroking. Importantly, only tetraplegics showed the effect also after synchronous face stroking. CONCLUSIONS: RHI may reveal plastic phenomena in SCI. In hand representation-deprived tetraplegics, stimuli on the face (represented contiguously in the somatic and motor systems), drive the sense of hand ownership. This hand-face remapping phenomenon may be useful for restoring a sense of self in massively deprived individuals.},

abstract = {Embodied cognition theories postulate that perceiving and understanding the body states of other individuals are underpinned by the neural structures activated during first-hand experience of the same states. This suggests that one's own sensorimotor system may be used to identify the actions and sensations of others. Virtual and real brain lesion studies show that visual processing of body action and body form relies upon neural activity in the ventral premotor and the extrastriate body areas, respectively. We explored whether visual body perception may also be altered in the absence of damage to the above cortical regions by testing healthy controls and spinal cord injury ({\{}SCI){\}} patients whose brain was unable to receive somatic information from and send motor commands to the lower limbs. Participants performed tasks investigating the ability to visually discriminate changes in the form or action of body parts affected by somatosensory and motor disconnection. {\{}SCI{\}} patients showed a specific, cross-modal deficit in the visual recognition of the disconnected lower body parts. This deficit affected both body action and body form perception, hinting at a pervasive influence of ongoing body signals on the brain network dedicated to visual body processing. Testing {\{}SCI{\}} patients who did or did not practise sports allowed us to test the influence of motor practice on visual body recognition. We found better upper body action recognition in sport-practising {\{}SCI{\}} patients, indicating that motor practice is useful for maintaining visual representation of actions after deafferentation and deefferentation. This may be a potential resource to be exploited for rehabilitation.},

abstract = {Peripersonal Space (PPS), i.e. the space where we can interact with objects, may be 
modulated by a variety of factors ranging from tool use to ability to act in it. For 
example, people with paraplegia consequent to spinal cord injury exhibit profound 
alterations of the PPS around the feet, i.e. the body parts that cannot be moved 
because of the lesion. Importantly, however, 15 minutes of passive mobilization of 
the lower limbs may restore PPS in paraplegics. The aim of the present study is to 
understand if the feet PPS recovery is an effect of the vision of the motion, or if 
actual motion of the lower limbs is necessary. Moreover, the study aims to illuminate 
the role of the autonomic system, if any, in the recovery of feet PPS. To achieve 
this objective we recorded Skin Conductance Level (SCL) and the Respiratory Sinus 
Arrhythmia (RSA) as indexes of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems, 
respectively. In two experiments we studied the modulatory role of visual-motor 
stimulation on feet PPS. The first experiment started with a baseline condition after 
which participants observed through a Virtual Reality (VR) device videos with pas-
sive movements of lower limbs, while an unseen experimenter could move or not 
move their real lower limbs (2 counterbalanced conditions). The second experiment 
started with a baseline condition after which participants observed in VR still lower 
limbs, while an experimenter could move or not move their real lower limbs. During 
the observation of the videos, each lasting 2', we recorded the SCL and RSA. After 
each video, the extension of feet PPS was estimated through a visuotactile cross-
modal paradigm. In each experiment we tested 3 groups of 14 participants (Para-
plegic Complete, PC, Paraplegic Incomplete, PI, and Healthy Controls, HC). Data 
analysis, conducted within the Bayesian framework, show that in PC the recovery of 
feet PPS is linked to visual stimulation, while in HC is always present. Interestingly, 
in PI the results depend from the neurological level of lesion. Importantly autonomic 
reactivity in the PC group correlated to feet PPS during the vision of still legs, while 
their legs were actually moved. Our results suggest that visual feedback can lead to 
a feet PPS recovery in PC. Importantly, although these patients are not consciously 
aware of lower-limbs motion, their autonomic functions respond to visual-motor 
incongruities.},

abstract = {The human visual system is highly tuned to perceive actual motion as well as to extrapolate dynamic information from static pictures of objects or creatures captured in the middle of motion. Processing of implied motion activates higher-order visual areas that are also involved in processing biological motion. Imagery and observation of actual movements performed by others engenders selective activation of motor and premotor areas that are part of a mirror-neuron system matching action observation and execution. By using single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation, we found that the mere observation of static snapshots of hands suggesting a pincer grip action induced an increase in corticospinal excitability as compared with observation of resting, relaxed hands, or hands suggesting a completed action. This facilitatory effect was specific for the muscle that would be activated during actual execution of the observed action. We found no changes in responsiveness of the tested muscles during observation of nonbiological entities with (e.g., waterfalls) or without (e.g., icefalls) implied motion. Thus, extrapolation of motion information concerning human actions induced a selective activation of the motor system. This indicates that overlapping motor regions are engaged in the visual analysis of physical and implied body actions. The absence of motor evoked potential modulation during observation of end posture stimuli may indicate that the observation-execution matching system is preferentially activated by implied, ongoing but not yet completed actions.},

Emergent awareness refers to a specific facet of motor unawareness in which anosognosic subjects recognise their motor deficits only when they have been requested to perform an action and they realise their errors. Four participants in the chronic phase after a stroke with anosognosia for hemiplegia were recruited. They took part in an "error-full" or "analysis of error-based" rehabilitative training programme. They were asked to attempt to execute specific actions, analyse their own strategies and errors and discuss the reasons for their failures. Pre- and post-training and follow-up assessments showed that motor unawareness improved in all four patients. These results indicate that unsuccessful action attempts with concomitant error analysis may facilitate the recovery of emergent awareness and, sometimes, of more general aspects of awareness.},

The postural manipulation of the entire body turned out to influence the degree of tactile detection. In particular, RBD patients with tactile deficits detected a significantly higher number of left-sided stimuli in the supine posture than in the upright posture. Moreover, crossing of hands improved the ability of RBD patients with tactile deficits in detecting stimuli delivered to their left contralesional hand. The beneficial effect of lying supine was independent of the spatial position of the hands, thus suggesting that the improvement of performance dependent upon entire-body posture and that dependent upon crossing hands may rely upon separate mechanisms. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2005.},

abstract = {The corpus callosum is frequently damaged by closed head traumas, and the resulting deficits of interhemispheric communication may vary according to the specific position of the lesion within the corpus callosum. This paper describes a single case who suffered a severe traumatic brain injury resulting in a lesion of the posterior body of the corpus callosum. Among the classical symptoms of interhemispheric disconnection, left hand anomia, left upper limb ideomotor dyspraxia, left visual field dyslexia and dysnomia, and left ear suppression in a dichotic listening task were observed shortly after the injury but recovered completely or almost completely with the passage of time. The only symptom of interhemispheric disconnection which was found to persist more than 4 years after the injury was an abnormal prolongation of the crossed-uncrossed difference in a simple visuomotor reaction time task. This prolongation was comparable with that observed in subjects with complete callosal lesions or agenesis. The results suggest that the posterior body of the corpus callosum may be an obligatory interhemispheric communication channel for mediating fast visuo-motor responses. The transient nature of other symptoms of interhemispheric disconnection suggests a relatively wide dispersion of fibers with different functions through the callosal body, such that parts of them can survive a restricted lesion and allow functional recovery of hemispheric interactions. An assessment of the evolution in time of symptoms of interhemispheric disconnection following restricted callosal lesions may reveal fine and coarse features of the anatomo-functional topography of the corpus callosum.},

abstract = {Anarchic hand syndrome (AHS) is a rare neurological condition characterized by seemingly purposeful, goal-directed hand movements which the person afflicted by the syndrome is not, however, in control of. By extensively examining a patient with AHS we provide novel neuropsychological and lesion mapping data that shed new light on the possibility of modulating specific symptoms associated with AHS, in particular unilateral apraxia and magnetic apraxia. Moreover, we compared lesion mapping data with an in depth analysis of previous studies in order to explore the neural network responsible for the complex symptomatology associated with this syndrome. We found that non-primarily motor variables (e.g. the nature of the object to be grasped and integration of visuo-spatial feedback in action) play an important role in determining AHS symptomatology. Moreover, we found that lesions involving various different parts of the motor control network (the corpus callosum, the anterior cingulate cortex and the supplementary motor area, the parietal areas and thalamus) are closely linked to partially differing AHS symptoms. The comparison of our data with those reported in previous studies indicate that AHS is a multifaceted and complex syndrome in which the influence of non-primarily motor, emotional and higher-order components may be largely underestimated.},

abstract = {Apraxia is a well-known syndrome characterized by the sufferer's inability to perform routine gestures. In an attempt to understand the syndrome better, various different theories have been developed and a number of classifications of different subtypes have been proposed. In this article review, we will address these theories with a specific focus on how the use of objects helps us to better understand upper limb apraxia. With this aim, we will consider transitive vs. intransitive action dissociation as well as less frequent types of apraxia involving objects, i.e., constructive apraxia and magnetic apraxia. Pantomime and the imitation of objects in use are also considered with a view to dissociating the various different components involved in upper limb apraxia. Finally, we discuss the evidence relating to action recognition and awareness of errors in the execution of actions. Various different components concerning the use of objects emerge from our analysis and the results show that knowledge of an object and sensory-motor representations are supported by other functions such as spatial and body representations, executive functions and monitoring systems.},
