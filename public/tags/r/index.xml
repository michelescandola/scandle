    <description><![CDATA[<p>Dear all, it is with the greatest pleasure that announce that this new article
is finally accepted by Neuropsychologia!</p>
<p>This article, co-authored with a friend, Daniele Romano, is potentially
the beginning of a new way and of a new field in Single Case studies.</p>
<p>The github version of the R package is already able to manage
binomial data!</p>]]></description>

<p>In Bayesian Statistics a lot of packages are devoted in applying the most
complex and fascinating, model-based, statistics.</p>
<p>Something that is less covered are base-level statistics, such as
correlation.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[Hi all!
After a long journey, the bmscstan package is finally on CRAN, with a comprehensive vignette that shows how to use the package and how to check if everything is OK.
The idea is to further extend its functions to non-gaussian dependent variables, however, this version is already ready to use.
You can find its validation here.

    <description><![CDATA[true  Linear regression is not tricky, basically, we are trying to estimate a line that efficiently interpolates our data.
The focus of this page is to understand how the coefficients of a linear model are estimated by means of unbiased estimators.
An unbiased estimator algorithm tries to find the best coefficients able to interpolate your current sample of data. In this case, the word bias has no relation with the notion of cognitive biases.]]></description>
