    <description><![CDATA[<p>Dear all, it is with the greatest pleasure that announce that this new article
is finally accepted by Neuropsychologia!</p>
<p>This article, co-authored with a friend, Daniele Romano, is potentially
the beginning of a new way and of a new field in Single Case studies.</p>
<p>The github version of the R package is already able to manage
binomial data!</p>]]></description>

<p>In Bayesian Statistics a lot of packages are devoted in applying the most
complex and fascinating, model-based, statistics.</p>
<p>Something that is less covered are base-level statistics, such as
correlation.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[Hi all!
After a long journey, the bmscstan package is finally on CRAN, with a comprehensive vignette that shows how to use the package and how to check if everything is OK.
The idea is to further extend its functions to non-gaussian dependent variables, however, this version is already ready to use.
You can find its validation here.

    <description><![CDATA[<p>The version 1.0.0 of the package <code>bmscstan</code> is ready to use!</p>
<p>Its purpose is to provide a general, simple interface to analyse
single case studies with an lme4-like syntax.</p>
<p>You can find it on my github page, <a href="https://github.com/michelescandola/bmscstan,">https://github.com/michelescandola/bmscstan,</a>
and you can install it by typing in the R console
<code>devtools::install_github(michelescandola/bmscstan)</code>.</p>]]></description>
