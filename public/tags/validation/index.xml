    <description><![CDATA[<p>Dear all, it is with the greatest pleasure that announce that this new article
is finally accepted by Neuropsychologia!</p>
<p>This article, co-authored with a friend, Daniele Romano, is potentially
the beginning of a new way and of a new field in Single Case studies.</p>
<p>The github version of the R package is already able to manage
binomial data!</p>]]></description>
