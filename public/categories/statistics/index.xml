    <description><![CDATA[Hi all!
After a long journey, the bmscstan package is finally on CRAN, with a comprehensive vignette that shows how to use the package and how to check if everything is OK.
The idea is to further extend its functions to non-gaussian dependent variables, however, this version is already ready to use.
You can find its validation here.
Dear all, I am very happy to announce that bmscstan, the R package for Bayesian Multilevel Single Case Models is on CRAN: https://t.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[true  library(knitr) library(captioner) fig_nums &lt;- captioner() cod_nums &lt;- captioner( prefix = &quot;Code&quot; ) Some days ago I wrote some notes concerning unbiased estimators, that are the estimators that we commonly use with linear models, and statistical analyses such as ANOVA, linear regression, etcâ€¦
Unbiased estimators try to estimate the best unknown but not casual, \(\beta\) coefficients of the independent variables (i.v.) to explain the observed dependent variable \(y\) (d.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[true  Linear regression is not tricky, basically, we are trying to estimate a line that efficiently interpolates our data.
The focus of this page is to understand how the coefficients of a linear model are estimated by means of unbiased estimators.
An unbiased estimator algorithm tries to find the best coefficients able to interpolate your current sample of data. In this case, the word bias has no relation with the notion of cognitive biases.]]></description>
