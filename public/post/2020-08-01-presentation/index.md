# Presentation


## Short bio and Research Interests

I am a researcher in the neuroscience field, interested in body, action, space
and time representations at the [NPSY-Lab.VR][1], [University of Verona][UniVR].

In particular, my research work is focused on patients with a spinal cord lesion,
people that are experiencing in their everyday life a body-brain disconnection
from both the sensorial and motor functionality. I finished my Ph.D. in 2015 in
Social and Affective Neuroscience at the University “La Sapienza” or Rome
(Italy) of [prof. Salvatore M. Aglioti][2], under the
supervision of [prof. Valentina Moro][3].

I co-coordinate, altogether with prof. Valentina Moro,
the [“International Research Group into Spinal Cord Injuries”][SCI-ResearchGroup].

I am an expert in Bayesian Statistics. I coordinate the
[BASIC-NPSY Research Group][BASIC-NPSY] and I have organized a
summer school concerning [Bayesian statistics "BayesHSC"][BayesHSC].

## Teaching

I teach at the [University of Verona][UniVR] “Neuroscience of Learning” and the laboratory “Body and disability”.
