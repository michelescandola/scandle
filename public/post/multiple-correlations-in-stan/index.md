# Multiple correlations in Stan


In Bayesian Statistics a lot of packages are devoted in applying the most
complex and fascinating, model-based, statistics.

Something that is less covered are base-level statistics, such as 
correlation.

The tet of the correlation is very often paired with a null-hypothesis
test and relative p-value.

I am not very fond on this approach, because originally
correlation was not thought as a frequentist test, and because its
significance is very prone to the sample size.
