# New preprint! The development of a standard procedure for the optimal reliability-feasibility trade-off in Multilevel Linear Models analyses in Psychology and Neuroscience.


A new preprint was released yesterday February $8^{th}$!

In this paper we propose a clear step-by-step guide to select random effects
structures for multilevel linear models.

The approach has been validated by means of an extensive simulation study.

Importantly, in this work we try to find the optimal trade-off between
conputational resources and statistical soundness.
