&lt;p&gt;In Bayesian Statistics a lot of packages are devoted in applying the most
complex and fascinating, model-based, statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that is less covered are base-level statistics, such as
correlation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>true  library(knitr) library(captioner) fig_nums &amp;lt;- captioner() cod_nums &amp;lt;- captioner( prefix = &amp;quot;Code&amp;quot; ) Some days ago I wrote some notes concerning unbiased estimators, that are the estimators that we commonly use with linear models, and statistical analyses such as ANOVA, linear regression, etcâ€¦
Unbiased estimators try to estimate the best unknown but not casual, \(\beta\) coefficients of the independent variables (i.v.) to explain the observed dependent variable \(y\) (d.</description>

      <description>true  Linear regression is not tricky, basically, we are trying to estimate a line that efficiently interpolates our data.
The focus of this page is to understand how the coefficients of a linear model are estimated by means of unbiased estimators.
An unbiased estimator algorithm tries to find the best coefficients able to interpolate your current sample of data. In this case, the word bias has no relation with the notion of cognitive biases.</description>
