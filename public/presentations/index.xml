      <description>true  Linear regression is not tricky, basically, we are trying to estimate a line that efficiently interpolates our data.
The focus of this page is to understand how the coefficients of a linear model are estimated by means of unbiased estimators.
An unbiased estimator algorithm tries to find the best coefficients able to interpolate your current sample of data. In this case, the word bias has no relation with the notion of cognitive biases.</description>
