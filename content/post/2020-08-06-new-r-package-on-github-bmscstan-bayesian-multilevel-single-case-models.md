The version 1.0.0 of the package `bmscstan` is ready to use!

Its purpose is to provide a general, simple interface to analyse
single case studies with an lme4-like syntax.

You can find it on my github page, https://github.com/michelescandola/bmscstan,
and you can install it by typing in the R console
`devtools::install_github(michelescandola/bmscstan)`.

The package is currently under evaluation on CRAN, and the 
article with the validation (written with
[Daniele L. Romano](https://labmaravitabicocca.wixsite.com/maravita-lab-bicocca/about-us))
is submitted (finger crossed!).
