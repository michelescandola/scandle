Dear all, it is with extreme plaseure that I am announcing the 
new article of Valentina Moro (that I am co-authoring).

> Moro, V., Besharati, S., *Scandola, M.*, Bertagnoli, S., Gobbetto, V., Ponzo, S., Bulgarelli, C., Fotopoulou, A., & Jenkinson, P.M. (2021) The Motor Unawareness Assessment (MUNA): A new tool for the assessment of Anosognosia for hemiplegia, Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology, https://doi.org/10.1080/13803395.2021.1876842 

### Abstract:

**Introduction:** Anosognosia for hemiplegia (AHP) is a condition in which
patients with paralysis are
unaware of their motor deficits. Research into AHP is important for improving
its treatment and
providing insight into the neurocognitive mechanism of motor awareness.
Unfortunately, most
studies use assessments with widely recognized limitations.The study aims at
developing
a psychometrically validated assessment of AHP.

**Method:** We developed a 40-item Motor Unawareness Assessment (MUNA) and
administered it to
131 right-hemisphere stroke patients. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was
used to identify the
underlying factor structure. Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis
was used to determine diagnostic cutoffs, and Area Under the Curve (AUC)
analysis used to assess these cutoffs.
Relationships with demographic, clinical and neuropsychological variables
were explored.

**Results:** Five factors were identified: explicit motor awareness,
implicit motor awareness, impaired
sense of ownership, agency and illusory movement, and emotional reactions.
Established cutoffs
had excellent sensitivity and specificity. Clinical, neuropsychological and
demographic variables
did not predict overall MUNA score but were related to specific subcomponents.

**Conclusion:** The MUNA can differentiate various facets of AHP and provides a
detailed profile of
(un)awareness. The MUNA can therefore provide robust assessment for research
purposes and
assist clinicians when developing targeted rehabilitation.
